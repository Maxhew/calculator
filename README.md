# calculator
Its my first python project, so there might be some parts you don't like it but if you comment nicely, i can fix my errors and i may be better. Thank you guys <3

First of all, as I said above, this is my first serious project and it's been 1-2 months since I started using python. 
In this project, I tried to make an advanced calculator as much as I could, and I even added a game to the calculator. 
I also added 2 language options. You can use this calculator in english and turkish. Thank you for reading and supporting.
